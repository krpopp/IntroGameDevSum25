	"Death: Now, Let's wrap up the full story... And find out why you are dead",
   
   "This story begins with two girls, Jane and Luan. And you, are Jane's beloved cat. Jane and Luan had been the very best of friends for as long as they could remember, 14 years of secrets whispered under blankets and pinkie promises that lasted forever. For Jane, she lost her mother when she's four, Luan had gradually become the one who filled that maternal void, a sister without blood ties, a best friend, and someone she simply couldn't afford to lose. But Luan... Jane has always been something more than that...Luan loves Jane.",
    
	"Luan's secret love is desperate and obsessive. She was terrified to reveal her attraction to women and her desire for Jane. Yet, every time Jane grew close to someone *anyone, whether man or woman*, Luan's vision darkened with something jagged. Then came that afternoon, Luan confessed her feelings to Jane......",
   
   "The words tore free like a confession at gunpoint... ",
	
	"The confession hit Jane precise and unexpected, piercing straight through her world. Like a stone cast into still waters, sending concentric circles of chaos radiating outward... <<< I appreciate it, I truely do, but No, Luan. I'm sorry... You've always been like a sister to me. I love you more than I love everyone else, Luan, just not in the way you want. Can we just... go back to how things were? Please, I can't lose you, too. >>> ...",
	
	"Luan's ego shattered like glass hitting concrete. She had expected this, yet now that it was real, her body betrayed her with uncontrollable tremors, her voice stolen by the weight of humiliation. Jane watched, her own panic rising *something was wrong. Very wrong... ",
	
	"The emotional aftershocks of that confession still lingered in the air, heavy and unspoken. Jane sat at home, clutching you tight against her chest, as if seeking anchor in the storm. Her voice wavered as she recounted her disbelief: <<< What do I do? Will she just... walk out of my life now? Losing her would feel like losing a part of myself. She didn't say a word before leaving. Didn't even look at me. God I must have shattered her. >>> Then, quieter, a new fear slithered into her tone...",
	
	" <<< She was trembling so violently... What if she hurt herself...>>> Jane cut herself off, unable to voice the dread coiling in her gut.",
	"Luan didn't hurt herself, not in the way Jane feared. Instead, something far colder took root inside her. A slow, seething rage that twisted into something childish yet grotesque. She found herself mimicking the melodramatic revenge plots from TV dramas, digging through her belongings until her fingers closed around it * a backpack charm she'd stolen from Jane's room last year. Then, with meticulous precision, she scrawled a curse onto the trinket in jagged strokes: ",
	"  <<< I want Jane to die. Let her get hit by a car, collapse right in front of me, gasping in pain as her blood spills out * just like how my heart is bleeding out now. >>>",
	"As the storm of Luan's rage finally dissipated, the cursed charm * now bearing those dark, impulsive words * was left forgotten on her desk, discarded like the remnants of a childish tantrum. Jane remained oblivious. She had no idea Luan could ever harbor such venom toward her. And Luan? She told herself it had just been a joke, a dramatic, meaningless outburst, nothing more. The kind of over_the_top theatrics she'd seen in TV shows, where curses were just exaggerated metaphors for heartbreak...",
	"It didn't mean anything. Deep down, she still loved Jane. That much, at least, was real. Surely, such a silly little ritual couldnâ€™t actually come true...",
	"After that night, and ever since then, Luan never brought up the confession again. She buried it deep, forcing herself to act as if nothing had changed * laughing at Jane's jokes, nudging her shoulder like always, her performance so convincing even she almost believed it. And Jane? She was relieved that Luan still wanted her in her life. So she, too, played along, tiptoeing around the unspoken truth like it was a sleeping beast...",
	"Two best friends. One lie...",
	
	"Jane eventually began dating someone, a devoted boy who adored her, named Jason. Meanwhile, Luan threw herself into a series of short_lived flings with women, each relationship burning bright and fast before fizzling out within weeks. None lasted more than a month. Every kiss felt like a betrayal; not to her lovers, but to Jane. Luan told herself she was moving on. But the truth was, she was only running in circles * each new girl just another failed distraction from the one she couldn't have...",
	
	"But life, relentless in its unpredictability, spared no one * not except Jane. Four years of fragile normalcy passed. Then, on an otherwise ordinary evening, an unexpectable happened: Jason collapsed without warning, his heart giving out before the ambulance could even arrive. Just like that, a Cardiac Arrest and Gone. No warnings. No goodbyes. Jane lost another loved one of her life. Maybe She jsut can never get along with the number 4...",
	
	"For a months after Jason's death, Jane neary withdrew from the world. She took a year off from university and barricaded herself in her apartment, shutting out contact with equal determination. The door stayed locked. Friends and family came knocking, only to be met with silence. Luan, however, the only people that Jane allowed to visit, with Jane's apartment key, moved freely through Jane's closed apartment door and Jane's self-imposed isolation...",
	
	"Luan visited Jane every day, bringing fresh flowers for her and cat food for you. She sang to Jane, did her university homework at Jane's place while keeping her company, shared funny stories from school, drew pictures for her, taught her how to mix cocktails... She tried everything related to Jane's hobbies to gently coax her back into experiencing the world.",
	
	"Deep inside, the moment Jason died, Luan felt an electric rush of relief * finally, she was once again the most important person in Jane's life. But watching Jane unravel in grief infuriated her. Why should she mourn so deeply for a dead man? Yet when Jane refused to see anyone except her, Luan's bitterness gave way to perverse satisfaction.",
	
	"Now, tending to Jane's broken heart became Luan's sacred mission. Every shared silence, every accepted meal, every time Jane leaned into her touch * Luan catalogued these moments like precious trophies. She told herself she was helping. *And if part of her hoped Jane would never fully heal_well, that secret stayed buried, even from herself* ",
	
	"Jane couldn't comprehend and wouldn't comprehend Jason's sudden death. She even blamed herself for his passing, convinced it was due to a curse tied to the number 4 that seemed to mock her existence. In her mind, his death was the God's joke * just like when she was 4 and haven took her mother away. Desperate to prove her hypothesis wrong, Jane finally felt the urge to go outside again * jsut on the first day of the 4th month of her isolation.",
	
	"She convinced herself that stepping back into the world would prove she wasn't cursed * as if such a thing could be tested so simply, so absurdly. She made a bargain with herself, a desperate attempt to claw her way out of grief:",
	
	"<<< If I could survive this one day * if no one of my love died, and if I didn't die, then I would accept Jason's death and finally move forward. But if, if I died, at least I would go in peace. >>>",
	"So Jane told Luan: next Sunday * the first day of the new month * she would go out to the mall and take her cat to the vet for a checkup. Luan was overjoyed, believing her relentless efforts had finally broken through to Jane. She immediately agreed to accompany her. But due to a group meeting, Luan would have to arrive an hour and a half late.",
	"The Sunday...",
	"By the time Luan arrived at the mall, Jane had already left the ve with you * her cat * and was heading toward the nearby park. Following the shared location on the phone, Luan hurried in Your direction. Then, through the crowd, Luan spotted You two... ",
	"<<< JANE! >>>",
	"Luan's voice cut through the noise, sharp and desperate. But Jane didn't turn. Didn't even flinch, as if the sound had never reached her.",
	"???? < cann't she hear me > ????",
	"<<< JAAAAANNEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!>>>",
	"Louder this time, frantic enough that strangers turned to stare. Yet Jane kept walking.",
	"Even you heard Luan's desperate shouts * so why didn't Jane? You squirmed in Jane's arms, claws pricking through her sleeves, mewling loudly. But Jane moved like a sleepwalker, deaf to Luan's cries and ignored your moves. Her grip tightened mechanically as she marched forward through the crowd, her eyes fixed on some invisible point ahead.",
	"Jane followed the flow of the crowd until suddenly, unnaturally, she stopped. Right in the middle of the road. People streamed around her like water parting around a stone, their murmurs rising as they sidestepped the motionless girl clutching a cat. Luan fought against the current, but the crowd swallowed her efforts. She was close, so close, yet those final couples of meters might as well have been an ocean.",
	" <<< JANE?!>>>> Her scream tore through the air, but the person she's been calling still not heard",
	"The traffic light's numbers ticked down mercilessly: 15... 14... 13... 12... 11...",
	" <<< Jane! Come back or go to the other side, QUICK!! Stop STANDING THERE, YOU MIGHT BE HIT BY A CAR! >>>",
	"< hit by a car...? >",
	"The light blinked: 6, 5... The crowd had already cleared the crosswalk, except for Jane. She stood alone at the center of the road, holding you tight against her chest, her gaze vacant. Luan suddenly recalled the curse she'd scribbled at their 14th, that childish, venomous wish now clawing its way into reality. No. It couldn't be. It wasn't supposed to, She shoved through the remaining bodies, elbows sharp, breath ragged.",
	"4... 3...",
	"<<< JANE!! PLEASE!!! >>>",
	"You dug your claws deep into Jane's neck, raking red lines across her skin. Blood ran out but anything to snap her out of this trance. Jane didn't flinch. ",
	"2...1...",
	"Luan's heart seized with terror. <<< Jane! Get off the road! >>> she screamed, her voice raw with panic. The traffic light flashed crimson as a semi_truck barreled toward you and Jane with a deafening roar. Luan finally broke free from the crowd and sprinted toward you two. You watched in horror as Jane stood frozen, and frantically butted your head against her chest in warning.",
	"In that chaos_filled moment, you saw a spark of clarity seemed to return to Jane's eyes. Jane whipp around toward Luan just as the truck's grille filled your vision. In the last heartbeat before impact, Luan launched herself at you both. The crushing embrace of Luan's arms around you felt so absolute, that for one surreal instant: you were certain all three souls had crossed into the afterlife together.",
	
	"Haha, thanks for the story, now I know my cause of death, BUT where are Luan and Jane? You said we died together.",
	"Death: Aw, poor thing. Here's the ugly truth: Luan played hero, and look where it got her: road pizza. Jane? Oh, she's a sobbing wreck now, convinced the number four's out to get her. News flash, sweetheart: this wasn't your tragedy. Luan? She signed her own death warrant.",
	"But, if Luan's dead, why I am here, shouldn't Luan but the one here, collecting memories and speaking to you?",
	"Death: Ah... Well, I know this is hard to explain, but honestly? Even I don't understand why it happened, nor anything I can do to change it. But, yeah... Somehow, Luan's soul... forced her way into your body. She pushed your soul out. In other words: Luan stole your body, turned into a cat that can't speak... and you, my friend? You got something else. A one_way ticket to the afterlife. A chance to reincarnate.",
	"No... this isn't fair. I can't, I won't forgive Luan for this. But Jane... God, Jane's the real victim here. If she... if she ends her life because of this... I'll never rest.",
	"Death: Oh, don't get it taht way, at least, even monsters can do something nice sometimes, right? But if Jane offs herself? Ha! Fresh meat for the underworld, and Luan gets to live with it, mewling helplessly, forever. Delicious. Shall we... see how it plays out?",
	"Maybe you're right... but I refuse to stand by while Jane destroys herself. Enough. Let Jane call Luan a 'hero'. I choose to exit this farce. Ferry me away before I lose the will to move on."
	,"Death: Sure sure, emmmm. DO you want to become a human for your next life? So maybe you can find Jane someday.",
	"No, thanks, I'd rather be a cat that cannot talk."
