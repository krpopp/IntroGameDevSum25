This is a narrative game where player must to figure out which pizza to deliver and get the pizza from the restruant. Once they get everything ready, has to notice the verb where pizza temperature will goes down as time goes. They can get heater from the rubbish bin but also they can get a specical key from the hidden monster to get to a happy ending. While at the same time, the timer always reduces and it will show game over when pizza is not delivered on time, so as if player does not give out the correct pizza. They can also check whats on the paper to see more instructions. Additionally, there are useful tools in rubbish bin were will be randomly assigned out. So if get boost enegry drink, player can hold shift and accelerate to walk faster. And The issue with this game is potentially when I'm testing directly as main room it actually affects the setting when i set the intro to main roomand then move on to it. So there might be some potential issues with this config.
