unity narrative reflection:


this project was a really good recap on unity because the last time i used it was for high school and a 2d game that was like super buggy.

now i feel like i understand it a lot more and seeing how much bigger the scope is compared to gamemaker, its nice to get comfortable with it again.

however i still don't understand one thing: i can't use GetKeyDown properly because fsr it sometimes doesn't register? idk if im doing something wrong or not
but im using GetKey all the time so its registering for every single frame when something is being pressed and im somehow working around that

also istg the animation was so confusing to me. like i did NOT understand it and it took a lot of research and tinkering to finally get it to click. i did not
know you also had to manually adjust the animation transition time, so i was like : why is it lagging between transitions for like a few hours until i fINALLY
found the dropdown menu that says "transition timer" and set it to 0. now that i finally understand it, i feel super good lol

this goes the same with collision, i had no idea i had to check the "is trigger" box for the trigger thing to register. i was like "hello why aren't my debug
messages popping up"... that was so triggering (haha) lowkey took 2 days of procrastinating and pressing random buttons to figure that out 

anywy this project was honestrly so painful but im honestly glad i "finished"(?) it. if anything i learned a lot from it like lowkey i was like yeah i like gamemaker
more because im not smart enough for unity but it forced me to actually figure out how things worked yay
